# This is a project that aim to create an app similar to the famous SelfControl that is only for Mac on Linux

The objective is to prevent the access to a set of urls for a set amount of time, on the app you can set a definite amount of time or set the duration to _infinite_ to not permit the access anymore;
On the app is **impossible** to reduce the time set after setting it you can only add time, this means after setting an url to _infinite_ time you can't access anymore(A warning message will be showon before confirming the action)
